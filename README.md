This project aims to implement all the app ideas from the [florinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repository. The original repository is a curated collection of application ideas designed to help developers improve their coding skills by building real-world projects.

## Goals

- Implement a wide variety of app ideas to practice different programming concepts and technologies.
- Provide complete, runnable examples for each idea.
- Encourage learning through hands-on coding and exploration of various frameworks and libraries.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of programming (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end; Node.js, Python, etc. for back-end).
- Git for version control.
- A code editor like VS Code.
- Node.js or Python installed for running certain projects.

## Project Structure

The projects are divided into three tiers based on difficulty and required experience:

- **Tier 1: Beginner Projects** - For developers in the early stages of their learning journey, focused on user-facing applications.
- **Tier 2: Intermediate Projects** - For developers comfortable with UI/UX, development tools, and API services.
- **Tier 3: Advanced Projects** - For experienced developers learning advanced techniques like backend applications and database services.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/p55d2k/app-ideas-collection.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder of interest.
3. Follow the instructions in the project's README.md to set up and run the application.
4. Each project folder contains its own README with specific instructions on how to run and use the application.
